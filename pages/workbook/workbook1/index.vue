It provides a framework for formulating and solving equations, manipulating expressions, and understanding functions. Algebra is a fundamental tool for problem-solving, logical reasoning, and serves as a gateway to more advanced mathematical concepts.',

From the elegance of Euclidean geometry with its points, lines, and planes to more abstract concepts, it provides a visual and spatial understanding of our surroundings. Measurement complements geometry by providing the tools to quantify dimensions, areas, volumes, and angles. Together, they form a powerful framework for understanding the physical world.',
